# RunasDate
For people who can't compile this Python script, there is an executable build available in the release section. You can download it [here](https://github.com/programmer007007/RunasDate/releases/download/MK001/TimeSetter.exe).
Stops time of the program can be used on extending trails using python , similar to RunasDate . 
Note : 
1) No dll injection happens here.
2) This work with those programs which tries to check if the program has passed the trial days on start of the program , by falsing the system date and starting it then reverting to the original date.
For program which constantlly checks at regular interval if the program has expired then dll injection feature is what u are looking for,
If you happen to be a programmer then send me the pull request for dll injection code if u happen to fork and build this dll injection feature.
